This repository/project holds all of the packaged/published files for use in uploading onto an LMS or an HTML website; it does not hold the original project development files, as those files belong to Virtua Health of the South Jersey region.

Download the project/repository to your local computer, in a folder location of your choosing.  Once you unzip the downloaded repo package, in the projVirtExp directory (parent directory), you can open up the story.html or story.html5 file to open and access the completed Learning Module in your web browser.
